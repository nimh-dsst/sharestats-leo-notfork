## get_ipids.py

### 'IC': Institute or Center abbreviation

- Values are defined in the list 'ICs', which includes abbreviations for various NIH institutes and centers.

### 'YEAR': Year of the data

- Each 'IC' and year combination is used to make a request to the NIH website to retrieve data.

### 'IPID': Intramural Program Integrated Data (unique identifier)

- Values are obtained by scraping the NIH website using a POST request with specific parameters ('ic' and 'searchyear').

  - Regular expression (re.findall) is used to extract IPID numbers from the response text.
  - For each unique IPID, a row with 'IC', 'YEAR', and 'IPID' is added to the CSV, avoiding duplicates.

## get_pmids.py

### 'PI': Principal Investigator(s)

- The 'headings' and 'showname' HTML elements are searched for relevant labels to extract the names of Principal Investigators.

### 'PMID': PubMed ID

- A regular expression is used to find patterns matching PubMed IDs in the HTML content.

### 'DOI': Digital Object Identifier

- A regular expression is used to find patterns matching DOI values in the HTML content.

### 'PROJECT': Project associated with the report

- Extracted from the 'contentlabel' HTML element within the reports.

## get_pmids_articles.py

### 'pmids_articles.csv': Filtered CSV containing articles that meet specific criteria

- Removes publications with types: ['Review', 'Comment', 'Editorial', 'Published Erratum'].
- Only includes publications identified as articles based on PubMed API data.

## data_conversion.py

### Fetches information for PubMed articles, specifically titles and journal names

- 'pmid': PubMed ID (unique identifier for a publication in PubMed).
- 'title': Title of the PubMed article.
- 'journal': Name of the journal in which the article was published.
- Errors during the fetch process are logged, and corresponding entries in the CSV have empty strings for title and journal.

### Data Retrieval Process

- The program reads an existing CSV file ('pmids_articles.csv') containing PubMed IDs ('PMID').
- For each unique PubMed ID, it uses the Metapub library to fetch additional details, including the article title and journal.
- If an error occurs during the fetch process, the program records the PubMed ID and assigns empty strings to title and journal.

## filter_cli.py

- Takes an input directory and parses all *.pdf files in specified directory.
- Take an output CSV filepath and generates a table of pdf metadata and whether the PDF document contains the phrase "HHS Public Access" on the first page of the PDF. NOTE: the HHS public access versions of manuscripts  have "Antenna House" in the producer metadata for the test set. The creater metadata references either "Antenna House" or "AH" in the test set. This may be useful for cross-validation, but has not been tested with a large data set (test set n~3400 files).
- To only install dependencies for filter_cli.py please `pip install -r filter_requirements.txt`.

## R Script Dependencies

Currently using `renv` for package management.

### Packages

#### Binary installations

- Pandoc. [Installation Instructions](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). Required for [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent) packages's vignettes.
- pdftotext. Install [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/). For macOS use Homebrew: `brew install poppler`. See the OS Dependcies section on the [PYPI pdftotext module](https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/) for other OS installations of Poppler.

#### R Packages

##### CRAN

- devtools
  - Needed for installing packaged hosted on GitHub.
_ renv
  - Needed for loading R project environment so users do not need to manually install packages. *TODO: Add in section on using renv to load dependencies.*

##### GitHub

- [Open Data Detection in Publications (ODDPub)](https://github.com/quest-bih/oddpub). Required for [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent). *Must us v6.0!* If installing manually run `devtools::install_github("quest-bih/oddpub@v6")`. Updated ODDPub uses different parameters in latest version than is
- [CrossRef Minter (crminer)](https://github.com/cran/crminer). Required for [metareadr](https://github.com/serghiou/metareadr)
_ [Meta Reader (metareadr)](https://github.com/serghiou/metareadr). Required for [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent).

## Python Dependencies

### Pip-tools

In order to separate the develepment dependencies and the required depedencies, this project uses pip-tools. For running the scripts run `pip install -r requirements`. To develop on the codebase with tools that help with formatting, typing, and linting run `pip install -r dev.txt`.

### psycopg2

The PYPI package `psycopg2-binary` is used in `requirements.in` for compatiblity with pip-tools. This version of psycopg2 is not for production uses of POSTGRESQL. See [psycopg2-binary docs](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/) for an explanation.

### DSST-ETL

Some useful commands:

```
#install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# install all dependencies
uv sync --all-extras
# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# copy the mock environment variables to the file used by docker compose and the package
cp .mockenv .env

# start the postgres server
docker compose -f .docker/postgres-compose.yaml up -d

# stop the postgres server and remove the volume with -v
docker compose -f .docker/postgres-compose.yaml down -v

# install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# run the pre-commit hooks on all files
   pre-commit run --all-files

# run the tests
pytest
```

## Database Migrations

This project uses Alembic for database migrations. Follow the steps below to generate and apply migrations to the database.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Alembic installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install alembic  ```

- Make sure your database is running. If you're using Docker, you can start the database with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose -f .docker/postgres-compose.yaml up -d  ```

### Running Migrations

1. **Configure Alembic**: Ensure that the `alembic/env.py` file is correctly set up to connect to your database. This involves setting the SQLAlchemy URL in the `alembic.ini` file.

2. **Create a New Migration**: To create a new migration script, run the following command:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"   ```

   This will generate a new migration script in the `alembic/versions` directory.

3. **Review the Migration Script**: Open the generated migration script and review it to ensure it accurately reflects the changes you want to make to the database schema.

4. **Apply the Migration**: To apply the migration to the database, run:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head   ```

   This command will apply all pending migrations up to the latest one.

5. **Verify the Database**: Check your database to ensure that the schema has been updated as expected.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, ensure that your database connection settings in `alembic.ini` are correct.
- Check the Alembic logs for any error messages that might indicate what went wrong.

For more detailed information on using Alembic, refer to the [Alembic documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/).
